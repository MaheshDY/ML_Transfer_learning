# ML_Transfer_learning
The base_model.ipynb is the parent model which is trained on cats and dogs image classification dataset. The weights of this parent model are saved for later use.
This parent model is used as a base model for the image classification of another horses or humans dataset by using the same weights and slight modification to the parent model like using regularization and data augumentation.
